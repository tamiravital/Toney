### Journey timeline redesigned with emoji markers
- The Journey tab now shows a **vertical timeline** with emoji circles on a line — ⭐ for sessions where you had a real breakthrough or shift (not every session — only the ones where something genuinely changed), 🏆 for wins (things you did differently with money), and 🌱 for your first session.
- Each node has a **colored bubble** beside it with the text, date, and (for breakthroughs) which focus area it connects to.
- **Different focus areas get different colors** — so you can see at a glance which areas of your life are producing the most growth. Wins are always green.
- Breakthrough nodes are tappable — tap to read the full session notes from that breakthrough.

### Journey tab redesigned

- The Journey tab has been redesigned as a **growth dashboard** instead of a chronological session list.
- At the top, a **"Where you are" card** shows Toney's current understanding of you in one sentence. If you've been using Toney for a while, it also shows a contrast with an earlier observation — so you can see how far you've come.
- Your **focus areas** are the main content now. Each one shows the latest growth observation and counts of wins and reflections. Tap to see the full growth story.
- **Past sessions** are still accessible — just tap the book icon in the top right to browse them and read session notes.
- If you started using Toney before focus areas existed, the Journey shows your recent session headlines as tappable cards — so the screen is never empty.
- You can still log wins from the Journey tab.

### Rewire cards are now a swipeable flashcard deck

- Your Rewire Cards screen has been redesigned. Instead of a long scrollable list showing everything at once, cards are now displayed as a **flashcard deck** that you can swipe through.
- Each card shows just the **title and category icon** on the front — clean and easy to scan. Tap the card to **flip it over** (with a smooth 3D animation) to see the full content, date, and action buttons.
- **Swipe left or right** to browse between cards. The deck loops around — no dead ends when you reach the last card. You can keep swiping endlessly.
- Swiping feels natural — a quick flick is enough to advance, and the animation slows down smoothly like scrolling on an iPhone.
- The category filter tabs at the top (All, Reframes, Truths, Plans, etc.) work the same as before.
- Fixed a visual glitch where card shadows looked odd at the bottom corners.

### Wins no longer save multiple times
- When Toney celebrated a win during a session, it was sometimes being saved 3-10 times instead of once. You might have noticed duplicate entries on your Journey timeline. This is now fixed — each win saves exactly once.

### Wins feel like they matter now

- When Toney celebrates a win, it's no longer a flat green card that appears and disappears. The card now **animates in** — a thin green line expands into a warm, glowing card with a rotating trophy icon. It feels like a moment, not a footnote.
- Toney now **reflects your words back** before logging a win, and connects it to the bigger picture: "That's the kind of thing that rewires how your brain responds to money." If it connects to a focus area, Toney names it.
- **Session notes now mention your wins.** When you end a session, the summary highlights the victories you earned — they're woven into the narrative.
- **Session suggestions build on recent wins.** At least one suggestion for your next session explicitly references a recent win, so your progress carries forward.

### Wins are more visible everywhere

- The home screen now shows a **Win Momentum Strip** — a green card right below your last session, showing your latest win, how many you've earned this week, and a momentum label like "Most active week yet" or "3 wins this week."
- Toney's Coach now knows more about your wins — not just the text, but when they happened, how fast they're accumulating, and what patterns exist. It uses this to reference your progress more naturally.
- At **milestone win counts** (3, 7, 15, 30), Toney's opening message naturally acknowledges the pattern: "Seven moments now where you did something different. That's not random."
- When Toney's internal understanding of you evolves after each session, your wins are now treated as **primary evidence of real change** — not a sidebar.

### Wins now connect to your focus areas

- When Toney logs a win that relates to one of your focus areas (like "Feel okay spending on myself"), it **links them together**. The Coach uses a new format — `[WIN:focus=...]` — to specify which focus area a win belongs to.
- On your **Journey tab**, tapping a focus area now shows a new **"Evidence" section** — all the wins linked to that focus area, displayed as green cards with dates. You can see not just what Toney observed about your growth, but the actual moments that proved it.
- The Coach now sees your wins **grouped by focus area** in its briefing, so it can reference specific progress on specific intentions.

### Focus areas now show your growth

- Your focus areas (like "Feel okay spending on myself" or "Have the money conversation with my partner") now show how you're evolving — not just what you declared.
- After each session, Toney writes a brief observation about each focus area the session touched. These accumulate over time, creating a visible growth story.
- On the **home screen**, focus areas are now cards (instead of flat pills) showing the latest observation underneath. For example: "You bought yourself coffee and didn't spiral — that's new."
- On the **Journey tab**, you can tap any focus area to see its full growth timeline — every observation, newest first, with dates. You can also archive a focus area from here.
- Toney's Coach now reads the latest observation for each focus area before every session, so it can reference your specific progress naturally.
- This doesn't add any extra processing time — the observations are generated inside the same step that already happens after each session.

### Getting started is faster
- After finishing the quiz, the "Getting to know you..." wait is about half as long as before. Toney now processes your answers in two parallel steps instead of one big sequential one.
- You'll see a proper loading screen with a spinner and message while Toney prepares your first session suggestions.

### First session suggestions now appear reliably
- After onboarding, your personalized session suggestions now show up every time. Previously, you might have seen a blank screen, a "Start a Session" button instead of suggestions, or had to wait 45+ seconds. This was caused by the app trying to start your session before it finished processing your quiz answers — now it waits properly.

### Home screen is now a calm dashboard
- The home screen no longer scrolls and no longer shows session suggestions, streaks, or counts. It's a single screen with five tiles: your last session, a "What Toney Sees" snippet, your latest Rewire Card, your focus areas, and your last win.
- Growth shows through language, not numbers. The "What Toney Sees" tile is a single sentence that evolves after every session — you can watch how Toney's understanding of you deepens over time.

### Session suggestions moved to Chat
- When you open the Chat tab without an active session, you now see your personalized session suggestions (the featured card, compact rows, and "Or just start talking"). Previously these were on the home screen.
- Tapping a suggestion starts the session right there. No more navigating between screens.

### Chat input grows as you type
- The text box now expands as you write (up to 3 lines), like ChatGPT. You can see what you're typing without scrolling inside a tiny box.

### Session suggestions now show up when you open chat
- When you open the Chat tab, you should see your personalized session suggestions — cards like "What one container would choose you" or "The price that doesn't need proof." Previously, the screen was stuck showing your last completed conversation instead of these suggestions.

### Starting a session no longer fails
- Tapping a suggestion or "Start a Session" was sometimes showing an error: "I'm having trouble starting a session right now." This happened because Toney was trying to re-process your last session (which was already finished) before opening the new one. That unnecessary step has been removed.

### Ending a session is now fast
- When you tap "End Session," your session notes now appear within a few seconds. Previously, the screen would show "Wrapping up..." for 15-20 seconds (or appear to hang entirely). The behind-the-scenes learning that Toney does after each session now happens in the background — you don't have to wait for it.

### Settings: new depth slider
- Coaching depth is now a 1-5 slider (matching the tone slider) instead of three text options (Surface / Balanced / Deep). This gives you finer control over how deep Toney goes into root causes.

### Cards now save properly
- Rewire Cards you create in chat now save to your collection permanently. Previously, cards would appear in the conversation but silently fail to save — meaning they'd disappear when you closed the app. This is now fixed. Cards persist across sessions.
- Cards now display their title on the Rewire screen, and content renders with proper formatting (bold, lists, etc.).
- Backfilled cards that were lost for existing users by finding them in old conversation history.

### Session notes and summaries now save properly
- When you end a session, Toney generates session notes (headline + summary + key moments). These were silently failing to save — so your Journey timeline was showing sessions without any notes or titles. This is now fixed.
- Every session now has a proper title and notes you can read on your Journey.
- Backfilled notes for all existing users' past sessions.

### Focus Areas — track what you're working toward
- After onboarding, your goals from the quiz (like "stop stressing about money" or "feel okay spending on myself") now appear as Focus Areas on your home screen under "What I'm Working On."
- During conversations, Toney can suggest new focus areas when you articulate something you want to work toward. They appear as purple cards in chat — you choose whether to save them.
- Focus areas are ongoing intentions, not tasks. You can archive them when they're no longer relevant, but there's no "complete" button.
- Toney reads your focus areas before each session and uses them to connect surface-level concerns to deeper coaching work.

### Session Suggestions — personalized conversation starters
- After each session ends, Toney now generates 4–10 personalized suggestions for your next visit.
- Each suggestion has a title, a teaser, and a time estimate (quick 2–5 min, medium 5–10 min, deep 10–15 min, or always-available entry points).
- Suggestions reference your specific words, patterns, breakthroughs, and saved cards. They feel like something only Toney could say to *you*.
- Behind the scenes, each suggestion comes with a coaching strategy so the conversation starts smart if you tap it.

### Home screen redesigned
- Home now opens with a personalized greeting and a vertical list of session suggestions — the first is a featured card, the rest are compact rows.
- Your last session's headline and a snippet of notes are shown as a preview card.
- Focus areas appear under "What I'm Working On."
- Removed the old static tension type display.

### Journey tab replaces Wins tab
- The old "Wins" tab is now the "Journey" tab — a timeline of your coaching story.
- Shows sessions and wins grouped by day. Tap any session to read its notes.
- Wins that Toney celebrates in chat (when you report a real victory over your patterns) now auto-save to your Journey. Previously they were only stored temporarily and would disappear.
- You can also manually log wins with a "Log a Win" button.

### Toney now learns about you through a living narrative
- Instead of storing fragmented facts about you in separate categories, Toney now maintains a single evolving narrative — like a therapist's clinical notes — that deepens after every session.
- The narrative covers your triggers, breakthroughs, resistance patterns, emotional vocabulary, life context, what coaching approaches work for you, and where you are across 7 growth dimensions.
- After each session, the narrative is updated — not rewritten. New observations integrate with existing ones. Nothing is lost.
- This means Toney's understanding of you gets richer and more nuanced with every conversation, instead of being a flat list of extracted facts.
