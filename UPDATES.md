### Getting started is faster
- After finishing the quiz, the "Getting to know you..." wait is about half as long as before. Toney now processes your answers in two parallel steps instead of one big sequential one.
- You'll see a proper loading screen with a spinner and message while Toney prepares your first session suggestions.

### First session suggestions now appear reliably
- After onboarding, your personalized session suggestions now show up every time. Previously, you might have seen a blank screen, a "Start a Session" button instead of suggestions, or had to wait 45+ seconds. This was caused by the app trying to start your session before it finished processing your quiz answers — now it waits properly.

### Home screen is now a calm dashboard
- The home screen no longer scrolls and no longer shows session suggestions, streaks, or counts. It's a single screen with five tiles: your last session, a "What Toney Sees" snippet, your latest Rewire Card, your focus areas, and your last win.
- Growth shows through language, not numbers. The "What Toney Sees" tile is a single sentence that evolves after every session — you can watch how Toney's understanding of you deepens over time.

### Session suggestions moved to Chat
- When you open the Chat tab without an active session, you now see your personalized session suggestions (the featured card, compact rows, and "Or just start talking"). Previously these were on the home screen.
- Tapping a suggestion starts the session right there. No more navigating between screens.

### Chat input grows as you type
- The text box now expands as you write (up to 3 lines), like ChatGPT. You can see what you're typing without scrolling inside a tiny box.

### Session suggestions now show up when you open chat
- When you open the Chat tab, you should see your personalized session suggestions — cards like "What one container would choose you" or "The price that doesn't need proof." Previously, the screen was stuck showing your last completed conversation instead of these suggestions.

### Starting a session no longer fails
- Tapping a suggestion or "Start a Session" was sometimes showing an error: "I'm having trouble starting a session right now." This happened because Toney was trying to re-process your last session (which was already finished) before opening the new one. That unnecessary step has been removed.

### Ending a session is now fast
- When you tap "End Session," your session notes now appear within a few seconds. Previously, the screen would show "Wrapping up..." for 15-20 seconds (or appear to hang entirely). The behind-the-scenes learning that Toney does after each session now happens in the background — you don't have to wait for it.

### Settings: new depth slider
- Coaching depth is now a 1-5 slider (matching the tone slider) instead of three text options (Surface / Balanced / Deep). This gives you finer control over how deep Toney goes into root causes.

### Cards now save properly
- Rewire Cards you create in chat now save to your collection permanently. Previously, cards would appear in the conversation but silently fail to save — meaning they'd disappear when you closed the app. This is now fixed. Cards persist across sessions.
- Cards now display their title on the Rewire screen, and content renders with proper formatting (bold, lists, etc.).
- Backfilled cards that were lost for existing users by finding them in old conversation history.

### Session notes and summaries now save properly
- When you end a session, Toney generates session notes (headline + summary + key moments). These were silently failing to save — so your Journey timeline was showing sessions without any notes or titles. This is now fixed.
- Every session now has a proper title and notes you can read on your Journey.
- Backfilled notes for all existing users' past sessions.

### Focus Areas — track what you're working toward
- After onboarding, your goals from the quiz (like "stop stressing about money" or "feel okay spending on myself") now appear as Focus Areas on your home screen under "What I'm Working On."
- During conversations, Toney can suggest new focus areas when you articulate something you want to work toward. They appear as purple cards in chat — you choose whether to save them.
- Focus areas are ongoing intentions, not tasks. You can archive them when they're no longer relevant, but there's no "complete" button.
- Toney reads your focus areas before each session and uses them to connect surface-level concerns to deeper coaching work.

### Session Suggestions — personalized conversation starters
- After each session ends, Toney now generates 4–10 personalized suggestions for your next visit.
- Each suggestion has a title, a teaser, and a time estimate (quick 2–5 min, medium 5–10 min, deep 10–15 min, or always-available entry points).
- Suggestions reference your specific words, patterns, breakthroughs, and saved cards. They feel like something only Toney could say to *you*.
- Behind the scenes, each suggestion comes with a coaching strategy so the conversation starts smart if you tap it.

### Home screen redesigned
- Home now opens with a personalized greeting and a vertical list of session suggestions — the first is a featured card, the rest are compact rows.
- Your last session's headline and a snippet of notes are shown as a preview card.
- Focus areas appear under "What I'm Working On."
- Removed the old static tension type display.

### Journey tab replaces Wins tab
- The old "Wins" tab is now the "Journey" tab — a timeline of your coaching story.
- Shows sessions and wins grouped by day. Tap any session to read its notes.
- Wins that Toney celebrates in chat (when you report a real victory over your patterns) now auto-save to your Journey. Previously they were only stored temporarily and would disappear.
- You can also manually log wins with a "Log a Win" button.

### Toney now learns about you through a living narrative
- Instead of storing fragmented facts about you in separate categories, Toney now maintains a single evolving narrative — like a therapist's clinical notes — that deepens after every session.
- The narrative covers your triggers, breakthroughs, resistance patterns, emotional vocabulary, life context, what coaching approaches work for you, and where you are across 7 growth dimensions.
- After each session, the narrative is updated — not rewritten. New observations integrate with existing ones. Nothing is lost.
- This means Toney's understanding of you gets richer and more nuanced with every conversation, instead of being a flat list of extracted facts.
