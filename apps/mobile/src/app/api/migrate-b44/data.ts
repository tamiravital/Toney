I do it for my man. So I could grow and know I am always the woman I have dreamt of being.

To see and acknowledge the similarities. To combine between them and not having to choose. And I made it. I have built with my one heart two inner hearts for each of them and I built a bridge between them. That way I can move easily from one side to another and know no matter where I am — I am safe.
