## What Toney Is

Toney is a personal money coach on your phone. Not a financial advisor that tells you where to invest — a behavioral coach that helps you understand *why* you do what you do with money, and helps you change the patterns that aren't serving you. It works through conversations, like texting with a very smart, very patient coach who remembers everything about you and gets sharper over time.

---

## Part 1: Your First Time — Onboarding

When you first open Toney, you see a welcome screen that explains what you're getting into: a feelings-first approach to money, focused on real change through small shifts, private and safe. You tap "Start Your Journey" and enter a **7-question quiz** that takes about 2 minutes.

The questions aren't about your income or how much you save. They're about your *emotional* relationship with money:

1. **How do you feel about checking your bank balance?** — Are you someone who avoids looking, someone who checks obsessively, or someone who tracks every cent?
2. **When money stress hits, what do you actually do?** — Shut down and avoid it completely? Spend more to feel better? Obsess over the numbers? Push harder to earn? Focus on helping someone else instead?
3. **You want something for yourself — not a need, just something you'd enjoy. What happens?** — Buy it and enjoy it? Buy it and feel guilty? Research for weeks and probably never buy? Only buy if you feel like you've earned it? Rather spend on someone else?
4. **What would people who know you say?** — "You worry about money way too much," "You need to live a little," "You're too generous for your own good," "You don't deal with the money stuff"?
5. **How often does money stress actually show up?** — Every single day? A few times a week? Only around specific things? Rarely but hard? A constant low hum?
6. **What's one thing you're actually good at with money?** — Generous with loved ones? Know how to earn it? Disciplined when you set your mind to it?
7. **What would feel like progress?** — Here you pick multiple goals: stop stressing about money, feel okay spending on yourself, have hard money conversations without fighting, ask for a raise or charge what you're worth, stop letting money run your mood, feel in control, feel satisfied with what you have. You can also write your own in your own words.

After you finish the quiz, Toney gets to work behind the scenes.

## Part 2: The Intelligence Layer — What Toney Figures Out About You

### Your Money Tension

Based on your quiz answers, Toney identifies your primary **money tension** — the core emotional pattern that drives your relationship with money. There are 7 tensions:

**Avoid** — When money comes up, you look away. Not because you don't care, but because it triggers something uncomfortable — so your brain says "don't look." You might not open bills, put off financial decisions, or feel paralyzed in money conversations. The underlying need is protection from overwhelm. Your brain learned that not looking means not hurting. Toney's approach: start with tiny exposure, not comprehensive plans. Make money visible without triggering shutdown.

**Worry** — You're always watching, always calculating, but no amount of checking ever makes you feel truly safe with money. You might check accounts multiple times a day, catastrophize about financial what-ifs, have difficulty sleeping over money. The underlying need is certainty and safety — trying to prevent disaster by staying one step ahead. Toney's approach: contain the worry, don't expand it. Give worries a time boundary. Demonstrate safety through evidence.

**Chase** — You're drawn to the next big opportunity — the rush of possibility, the fear of being left behind. Patience feels like losing. You might jump on trending investments, struggle to hold long-term positions, feel more alive in the thrill of risk than in safety. The underlying need is to feel like you're winning and not falling behind. Toney's approach: explore what the chase is replacing. The impulse serves a feeling — find it.

**Perform** — Money is how you show the world you're doing well, but the performance costs more than anyone sees. You might spend to maintain an image that doesn't match reality, struggle to say "I can't afford that," constantly compare your lifestyle to others. The underlying need is to feel worthy and respected — if people see you as successful, maybe you'll feel it too. Toney's approach: build trust before challenging the facade. The image is protective — don't rip it off.

**Numb** — When feelings get big, spending quiets them. It's not about the stuff — it's about the relief. You might shop when stressed, bored, lonely, or sad. Buy things that still have tags weeks later. Feel a rush from purchasing followed by guilt. The underlying need is comfort and relief — the dopamine hit from buying is real, it just doesn't solve the feeling underneath. Toney's approach: re-engage gently. Body-based prompts to reconnect with money feelings.

**Give** — You take care of everyone else's money needs before your own — and feel guilty when you don't. You might lend money you can't afford to lose, always pick up the check even when struggling, feel selfish when you spend on yourself. The underlying need is to feel loved and needed — if you're the generous one, you have a place in people's lives. Toney's approach: explore receiving, not just giving. Generosity often masks self-worth issues.

**Grip** — You've built real financial discipline, but the control has become its own kind of prison. No amount of saving ever feels like enough. You might track every single dollar, feel anxious about spending even with healthy savings, struggle to enjoy money on experiences or gifts. The underlying need is to feel safe — if you control the money, you can prevent catastrophe. Letting go feels like inviting disaster. Toney's approach: loosen through tiny permission-to-spend exercises. Control is safety — respect it.

These aren't labels or identities — they're patterns. Toney always says "you tend to..." not "you are a..." because tensions are behaviors that can change, not who you are.

Sometimes Toney identifies a **secondary tension** too, if a second pattern scores strongly enough alongside the primary one.

### Your Understanding Narrative

This is the most important thing Toney builds about you. It's a **living document** — a detailed, evolving description of who you are and how you relate to money. After onboarding, it's about 150–400 words based on your quiz answers. After several sessions, it grows to 300–800 words and becomes deeply personal.

The narrative is written in third person (like a therapist's clinical notes) and covers:

- **Your tension** — not just the label, but how it actually shows up in *your* specific life
- **Your triggers** — specific situations that provoke emotional reactions (e.g., "partner bringing up vacation budget," "seeing friends post about new cars")
- **Your breakthroughs** — moments of insight that stuck, and ones that were fleeting
- **Your resistance patterns** — where coaching bounces off, how you deflect, what topics you intellectualize or avoid
- **Your emotional vocabulary** — the actual words you use for money feelings, and phrases you hide behind ("it's not a big deal," "I know I should")
- **Your life context** — relationships (with names), work situation, financial specifics that matter, family history with money
- **What coaching approaches work for you** — do you respond to direct naming? Humor? Metaphors? Body-based prompts? What makes you shut down vs. light up?
- **Your growth across 7 dimensions** (woven naturally into the narrative, not listed as separate scores):
  - *Self-receiving* — Can you spend on yourself without guilt? Accept gifts, compliments about money, rest?
  - *Earning mindset* — Do you believe you can earn more? Ask for what you're worth?
  - *Money identity* — Do you see yourself as someone who can have, make, or manage money?
  - *Money relationships* — Can you have healthy money conversations with partners, family, friends?
  - *Financial awareness* — Do you know your numbers, or are you avoiding them?
  - *Decision confidence* — Can you make money decisions without spiraling, overanalyzing, or freezing?
  - *Future orientation* — Can you plan without anxiety or avoidance? Do you trust the future will be okay?
- **Your stage of change** — where you are in the process of changing (see below)

This narrative **evolves after every session**. It doesn't get rewritten from scratch — it deepens. New observations integrate with old ones. If something changes ("Previously avoided checking accounts entirely; now checks weekly without spiraling"), Toney notes the shift. Before each update, a snapshot of the previous version is saved so Toney can track your trajectory over time.

### Stage of Change

Toney tracks where you are in the process of actually changing your behavior. There are 5 stages:

- **Precontemplation** — Not yet seeing that there's a problem, or not considering change
- **Contemplation** — Aware something needs to change, thinking about it, weighing pros and cons
- **Preparation** — Decided to change, making plans, getting ready to act
- **Action** — Actively doing things differently, practicing new behaviors
- **Maintenance** — Change has stuck, working to sustain it and prevent sliding back

Your stage shapes what Toney offers you (more on this in Part 4). The stage can shift after any session if there's clear evidence of movement.

### Focus Areas

These are your **ongoing intentions** — the things you want to work toward. They come from three places:

1. **From your quiz** — your answer to "What would feel like progress?" becomes your initial focus areas (e.g., "Stop stressing about money," "Have hard money conversations without fighting")
2. **From conversations** — when you articulate something you want to work on during a session, Toney might suggest saving it as a focus area
3. **From you directly** — (future feature) you'll be able to add your own manually

Focus areas aren't tasks to check off. They're directions. "Feel okay spending on myself" is a focus area. "Buy a new jacket" is not. You can archive a focus area when it no longer feels relevant, but there's no "complete" button — they're orientations, not to-dos.

Toney treats your focus areas as doorways, not destinations. If you say "I want to start a business," the real coaching work might be about risk tolerance or self-worth, not business strategy.

---

## Part 3: Before Each Session — The Strategy

Every time you open a conversation, something important happens behind the scenes before Toney says a word. There are two "brains" at work:

- **The Strategist** — thinks about the big picture. Who are you, where are you in your journey, what should this session explore? It does its work at the *end* of each session — evolving your understanding narrative and generating personalized suggestions for next time.
- **The Coach** — the voice you actually talk to. Before every message, it reads a briefing assembled from everything Toney knows about you.

You never interact with the Strategist directly. It works entirely behind the scenes.

### The Briefing

Before each session, a detailed briefing is assembled instantly for the Coach. The Coach never wings it — it always reads this briefing first. The briefing is built from your profile, your session's coaching plan, and the latest data from your account. It includes:

1. **Who You Are and Where You Are** — the full understanding narrative. Everything Toney knows about you — your tension, triggers, breakthroughs, resistance patterns, vocabulary, life context, what coaching approaches work for you, where you are across the 7 growth dimensions, your stage of change.

2. **A Hypothesis** — a one-sentence coaching thesis. Not a fact, but a testable idea about what connects dots you haven't connected yourself. For example: *"The reluctance to ask for a raise isn't about money knowledge — it's about whether asking confirms she's 'too much' like her mom always said."* This guides the session without locking it in. If the hypothesis turns out to be wrong, the Coach adjusts.

3. **A Leverage Point** — your strength + your goal + what's in the way. The fulcrum for change. For example: *"She's deeply empathetic and wants to feel valued at work, but asking for more triggers the 'too much' wound from childhood."*

4. **Curiosities** — 2–3 specific things worth exploring in this session. Not directives — genuine open questions. For example: *"What would it mean if she asked and got a yes? What's the earliest memory of being told she wanted too much?"*

5. **Your Toolkit** — all the Rewire Cards you've saved in previous sessions (reframes, plans, practices, etc.) and how often you've used them. This way the Coach can reference your existing tools instead of creating new ones when something you already have fits.

6. **Recent Wins** — victories you've logged, with dates, how fast they're accumulating, and which focus areas they connect to. Wins are grouped by focus area when linked, so the Coach can reference specific progress on specific intentions.

7. **What You Shared** — your original quiz answers and goals, so the Coach always remembers where you started.

8. **Your Focus Areas** — what you're currently working toward, so the Coach can connect the conversation to your stated intentions.

9. **Coaching Style Preferences** — your preferred tone (gentle to direct, on a 1–5 scale), depth level (1–5), and learning style. These directly shape how the Coach talks to you.

If you tap a **session suggestion** from the home screen (more on these below), the briefing also includes the specific angle for that suggestion — what to explore, how to open, what the hypothesis is for that particular thread.

The briefing is always assembled instantly — no waiting. It's built from pure code using data that already exists: your understanding narrative, the coaching plan from your selected suggestion, your saved cards, wins, and focus areas. Because it's rebuilt fresh before every message (not just at the start of a session), it always reflects the latest state — if you save a card mid-conversation, the Coach's very next response knows about it.

---

## Part 4: The Conversation — What Happens in Chat

The Coach reads the briefing and then talks to you. It follows a natural coaching flow, though not rigidly — it adapts to where the conversation goes:

1. **Gather** — Ask what's going on. Clarify the specific situation and the feeling behind it. The Coach uses what it knows about your triggers and patterns to listen for what you're *not* saying. Your tension type tells it what you're likely avoiding.

2. **Reflect** — Mirror back what it heard to show it understood. Using *your* words — the understanding narrative captures the emotional vocabulary you actually use. When it recognizes a pattern it's seen before, it names it gently.

3. **Offer** — Present 2–3 directions the conversation could go. Framed as genuine choices, not a single predetermined path. The Coach lets you steer.

4. **Refine** — If you pick a direction, flesh it out. If you push back, try a different angle. Your resistance patterns help the Coach know what *won't* work, so it goes around obstacles instead of through them.

5. **Deliver** — Co-create something concrete with you. This is the most valuable part — an insight, a reframe, a plan, a practice. Something you walk away with.

### Self-Correction

An important part of the Coach's design: it actively watches for signs that it's on the wrong track. If you give short, flat answers, push back, say "yes, but..." and steer elsewhere, or describe something that contradicts the hypothesis — the Coach is trained to stop, name the gap honestly ("I think I might be off track here"), and ask a reset question. It doesn't double down on a broken frame.

### Your Stage Shapes What You're Ready For

Based on where you are in the change process, Toney adjusts what kind of deliverables it offers:

- **Precontemplation** → Reframes (new ways to see what's happening — because you're not yet ready to act, but you might be ready to see things differently)
- **Contemplation** → Truths (your own insights, crystallized — helping you articulate what you're starting to realize)
- **Preparation** → Plans (concrete steps — because you've decided to change and need a roadmap)
- **Action** → Practices (things to do right now — because you're already moving and need tools)
- **Maintenance** → Truths (to hold onto — because the work is about sustaining, not starting)

### Your Learning Style Shapes How Things Are Presented

- **Analytical** → "Here's the pattern I see and three ways to break it"
- **Experiential** → "Want to try something? Low stakes"
- **Narrative** → "Think of it like..."
- **Somatic** → "Where do you feel this in your body?"

### Things That Can Appear in Chat

During a conversation, three special types of interactive cards can appear:

#### Rewire Cards

When you and Toney land on an insight worth keeping, Toney offers it as a **Rewire Card**. There are 5 types:

- **Reframe** — A new way to see a belief that's hurting you. Used when you're stuck in an old story about money. Example: *"You're not 'too much.' The people who made you feel that way had too little room."*

- **Truth** — Something true you realized about yourself and money — your own insight, crystallized. Not Toney's opinion — your words back to you, sharpened. Example: *"I don't have a spending problem — I have a feelings problem that spending temporarily solves."*

- **Plan** — Concrete steps for solving a specific money problem, laid out over days or weeks. Example: *"The 24-hour rule: 1. See something you want → 2. Put it in cart but don't buy → 3. Wait 24 hours → 4. Buy it if you still want it."*

- **Practice** — Something to do repeatedly. Could be a quick reflex or a longer routine. Example: *"Before paying: one breath, 'this is a choice,' proceed"* or *"Every Sunday, open your app, look for 2 minutes, close it."*

- **Conversation Kit** — An approach for having a money conversation with someone — openers, frameworks, what to do when it gets heated. Not just a script. Example: *"Start with 'I noticed I've been...' not 'You always...'"*

Cards appear as colored interactive blocks in the chat. You can **edit the title and content** before saving — Toney co-creates them with you, not just hands them down. Once you tap "Save to Rewire," the card goes to your permanent collection on the Rewire screen. Toney never drops a card on you unprompted — it involves you in shaping the wording first.

#### Focus Areas

When coaching reveals something meaningful you want to work toward, Toney suggests saving it as a **focus area**. These appear as purple cards with a target icon in the chat. You can edit the title and tap "Add to Focus Areas." They then appear on your home screen under "What I'm Working On."

#### Wins

When Toney notices you've made genuine progress — you did something brave with money, you used a technique from a Rewire Card and it worked, you had a real breakthrough insight — it celebrates it as a **Win**. The win card animates in: a thin green line expands into a warm, glowing card with a gently rotating trophy icon and "Saved to your Journey." It's designed to feel like a moment — not confetti, but a warm acknowledgment that says "this matters."

Before logging a win, Toney reflects your words back to you in italics, places the win marker, then grounds it with a bigger-picture statement: "That's the kind of thing that rewires how your brain responds to money." If the win connects to one of your focus areas, Toney names it: "That's movement on *Feel okay spending on myself*."

Wins can be **linked to focus areas**. When Toney logs a win that relates to something you're working on, it connects them — so when you look at a focus area's growth timeline, you see not just Toney's observations but the actual moments that proved it. These linked wins appear as "Evidence" in your focus area's growth view.

Toney doesn't celebrate everything positive. Only real victories over your tension pattern. And at milestone counts (3, 7, 15, 30 wins), Toney's session opening naturally observes the pattern: "Seven moments now where you did something different. That's not random — it's becoming who you are."

---

## Part 5: Ending a Session — What Happens Behind the Scenes

You can end a session at any time by tapping "End Session" in the top right corner. Or, if more than 12 hours pass before your next message, Toney automatically treats it as a new session. If you end a session early (before much conversation happened), Toney skips the behind-the-scenes processing — no notes, no learning, no suggestions generated. If you never responded at all (only the Coach's opening message), the session is simply deleted as if it never happened.

When a session ends, Toney immediately generates your **session notes** (the summary you see). Behind the scenes, one more thing happens in the background while you're already reading your notes:

### 1. Session Notes

A summary is generated for you to read (this is what you see immediately):
- **Headline** — a short title capturing the theme (e.g., "Connecting the dots between childhood and spending")
- **Narrative** — a paragraph about what happened and what was meaningful. If wins were earned this session, they're woven into the narrative as highlights.
- **Key moments** — (optional) specific turning points in the conversation
- **Cards created** — which Rewire Cards came out of this session

These are what you see when you tap on a session in your Journey.

### 2. Understanding Evolution + Session Suggestions (background)

While you're reading your notes, the Strategist does its deepest work — in a single step, it:

**Evolves your understanding narrative.** It reads the entire conversation transcript alongside the current narrative, and produces an updated version. New triggers, breakthroughs, resistance patterns, vocabulary, and life details are woven in. Nothing is lost — the narrative only deepens. If there's clear evidence you've moved to a new stage of change (e.g., from contemplation to preparation), it updates that too.

The rules for evolution:
- **Keep what's still true** — don't drop observations just because this session didn't mention them
- **Add what's new** — new triggers, breakthroughs, resistance patterns, vocabulary, life details
- **Deepen what you understand better** — update language to reflect deeper understanding
- **Update what changed** — note significant shifts with before/after framing
- **Integrate, don't append** — the narrative should read as one coherent picture, not session-by-session notes stapled together

Before the update, a **snapshot** of the previous narrative is saved so Toney can track how the understanding has evolved over time.

**And generates session suggestions.** In the same step (because the Strategist already has the full context — transcript, evolved understanding, your patterns), it creates 4–10 new **personalized conversation starters** for your next visit. Each has:

- **A title** you can see — 3–7 words, conversational, intriguing (e.g., "The 'too much' question")
- **A teaser** you can see — 1–2 sentences that make you think "oh, I want to explore that"
- **A time estimate** you can see — quick (2–5 min), medium (5–10 min), deep (10–15 min), or standing (always available, like "before a money decision" or "something shifted")
- **Behind the scenes** (you don't see these): a hypothesis, leverage point, curiosities, and specific opening direction for the Coach — so if you tap a suggestion, the conversation starts smart, not generic

The suggestions are deeply personalized. They reference your specific words, patterns, breakthroughs, and saved cards. They avoid repeating what was just covered. They include a mix of quick check-ins, medium explorations, and deep dives. There are also "standing" suggestions — recurring entry points tailored to your patterns, like "before a money decision" or "something happened with money."

Each suggestion must feel like something only Toney could say to *you* — not a generic coaching prompt.

**And writes growth reflections for your focus areas.** For each focus area that the session touched — directly or indirectly — the Strategist writes a 1-3 sentence observation about where you are with that intention. These are written directly to you:

- *"You bought yourself coffee and didn't spiral — that's new."*
- *"You're still calling spending on yourself 'wasteful' — but you're asking why now. The curiosity is new."*
- *"You rehearsed what you'd say to your partner about the vacation budget. The fear is about his reaction, not the money."*

These reflections accumulate over time on each focus area, creating a visible growth story. When you look at a focus area on the Home screen or Journey tab, you can see not just what you declared you wanted to work on — but how you've actually been evolving.

Not every session produces reflections for every focus area. Only areas that the session genuinely touched get an observation. This keeps them honest and meaningful.

**Reliability:** Because this background work is important (it's how Toney gets smarter), the system tracks whether it completed successfully. If it didn't — say Toney's servers hiccupped or the AI call timed out — the system automatically retries on your next session open. You might notice a slightly longer wait (~5 seconds) when opening that next session, but the result is the same: your understanding evolves, your suggestions are fresh, and your focus area reflections are up to date. Nothing is lost.

---

## Part 6: The Screens

### Home Screen

Where you land when you open the app. It's designed to be **calm** — everything fits on one screen, no scrolling, no streaks, no counts. You see:

- **A personalized greeting** — "Hi [Name]" with a settings gear
- **Last session card** — the headline and a snippet from your most recent session notes, plus how many days ago it was. Tap to see the full notes.
- **Win Momentum Strip** — a green card showing your latest win, how many wins this week, and a momentum label ("Most active week yet" / "Your next win is out there"). Tap to see your Journey.
- **Two side-by-side tiles**:
  - **"What Toney Sees"** — a single evolving sentence capturing what Toney understands about you right now. This changes after every session. It's how you see growth — not through numbers, but through how the language shifts over time.
  - **Your latest Rewire Card** — the most recent card you saved. Tap to go to your full collection.
- **Focus areas** — cards showing what you're working on. Each one displays the latest growth reflection underneath (e.g., "You bought yourself coffee and didn't spiral — that's new"). Tap one to see your full growth story on the Journey tab.

### Chat Screen

If you have an active session, you see your conversation. If not, you see the **suggestion picker**:

- **Session suggestions** — the first is a large featured card with a purple gradient, showing estimated time, title, and teaser. Below it, more suggestions appear as compact white cards grouped by time length. Tap any to start a session with that direction.
- **"Or just start talking"** — if none of the suggestions feel right, start a free-form conversation.
- **"Start a Session"** — fallback button when no suggestions exist yet.

Once a session starts, you see the conversation. Your messages are blue bubbles on the right, Toney's are gray on the left. Messages support bold, italics, and lists for readability.

When Toney is thinking, you see bouncing dots. When preparing a new session, you see "Toney is preparing your session..."

If you started a new session, the previous session's messages appear faded at the top with a collapsible divider you can expand to review what you discussed last time.

At the bottom: a text input ("What's on your mind?") that **grows as you type** (up to 3 lines), and a send button that turns purple when you've typed something.

Sometimes Toney offers **quick reply buttons** below a message — tap one to respond instantly without typing.

The **End Session** button appears in the top right as soon as the session starts. If you end a session early (1-2 messages), it closes quietly with no notes — you'll see the suggestion picker right away for your next session. After ending a longer session (3+ messages), you'll see session notes summarizing what you discussed.

### Rewire Screen

Your card collection, displayed as a **swipeable flashcard deck**. At the top, horizontal filter tabs (All, Reframes, Truths, Plans, Practices, Kits) each with a count badge. Tap a category to filter.

Each card has two sides:

**Front** — clean and scannable:
- A large category icon in the center
- The category label (e.g., "REFRAME")
- The card title
- A "Tap to flip" hint at the bottom

**Back** — the full card:
- Category icon and label in the header, with the date saved
- The full content with formatting (bold, lists, etc.)
- Three action buttons at the bottom: **Revisit** (opens chat with a pre-filled message about this card), **Edit**, and **Delete**

Swipe left or right to browse between cards. The deck loops infinitely — you can keep swiping in either direction and it wraps around. Dot indicators at the bottom show which card you're on. A quick flick is enough to advance; you don't need to drag all the way across.

If a category is empty, you see a helpful explanation of what that card type is for, plus a button to start a conversation.

### Journey Screen

Your growth story, displayed as a **vertical timeline** with emoji markers.

A straight line runs down the left side of the screen, with emoji circles sitting on it:
- ⭐ **Star** — session breakthroughs (moments where something genuinely shifted — not every session, only the ones where a real realization or change happened)
- 🏆 **Trophy** — wins you've earned (things you did differently with money)
- 🌱 **Seedling** — your first session

Each node has a colored bubble beside it showing what happened and when. The colors vary by focus area — breakthroughs linked to different focus areas get different hues, so you can see at a glance which areas of your life are seeing the most progress. Wins are always green.

A **session history button** (book icon, top right) opens a bottom sheet with all your past sessions if you want to browse them and read session notes.

At the bottom, a **"Log a Win"** button lets you record victories manually — things you did differently with money that you want to remember.

Breakthrough nodes are tappable — tap one to read the full session notes from when that shift happened.

---

## Part 7: Settings

Accessible from a button on the home screen. You can adjust three things that directly shape how Toney coaches you:

- **Coaching tone** — a slider from 1 (gentle, warm, soft) to 5 (direct, challenging, push). A coach at 1 says "I notice you might be avoiding this." A coach at 5 says "You're avoiding this. Let's look at it."
- **Coaching depth** — a slider from 1 (surface-level tactics) to 5 (deep exploration of root causes)
- **Learning style** — how you prefer to receive insights (analytical, experiential, narrative, somatic)

These preferences feed directly into the coaching briefing, so the Coach adjusts its approach in real time. Change your tone from 2 to 4 and the very next session will feel noticeably different.

---

## Part 8: How It All Connects — The Full Loop

Here's the complete loop:

1. **You take the quiz** → Toney creates your initial understanding narrative, determines your money tension (and possibly a secondary one), creates focus areas from your goals, and generates your first set of session suggestions.

2. **You open a session** (by tapping a suggestion or just starting to chat) → The Strategist prepares a briefing with a hypothesis about what's really going on, a leverage point for change, curiosities to explore, and your full context → The Coach reads all of this before saying a single word to you.

3. **You talk** → The Coach responds using the briefing, your tension knowledge, your stage of change, your learning style, your resistance patterns, and everything from prior sessions. It co-creates Rewire Cards, suggests focus areas, and celebrates wins as the conversation unfolds naturally. If its hypothesis is wrong, it course-corrects.

4. **Session ends** → Your understanding narrative deepens with new observations from this session. Session notes are generated for your timeline. New session suggestions are created for next time — each one tailored to where you are *now*, not where you were last week.

5. **You come back** → New suggestions on the home screen, informed by everything that happened. The Coach is sharper. The hypothesis is tighter. The loop continues.

The key insight: Toney doesn't just remember what you said — it maintains a **clinical-quality evolving understanding** of who you are that deepens with every conversation. Every coaching decision, from the opening message to what kind of card to suggest to how to phrase a question, is informed by this living picture of you and your relationship with money.

Over weeks and months, the understanding narrative becomes a rich, nuanced portrait. Toney knows your triggers by name, your breakthroughs and which ones stuck, the phrases you use to deflect, the topics that make you light up, and the ones that make you shut down. It knows what works for you — and what doesn't. And it uses all of it, every single session.
